          <strong>My beautiful love,</strong> From the moment you came into my life, everything changed. The world feels softer, brighter, and more beautiful because you are in it. When I look at you, I see my happiness. When I hold you, I feel like I’m exactly where I’m meant to be.

Your smile melts my heart. Your eyes make me forget everything around me. Even the way you say my name sounds special. You don’t just make me happy — you make me feel loved in a way I never felt before.

I love the little things about you. The way you laugh, the way you care, the way you get shy sometimes. Every small detail makes me fall in love with you again and again.

If I had one wish, it would be to stay by your side forever. To wake up next to you, to hold your hand, to build a life full of love and memories together.

You are my heart, my dream, and my forever.
I love you more than words will ever be able to say
